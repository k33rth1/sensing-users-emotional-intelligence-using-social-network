TITLE       - sensing emotional intelligence using social network
DESCRIPTION - This project explains about EI prediction models that evaluate the user’s EI by analyzing the text and interactive information in social networks. 
              Through the text that they published and the basic information, including the number of comments, the number of retweets, and publishing time, we carefully select a set of rules based on conceptualizations of EI. 
              Thus, the models are based on four dimensions, including self-awareness, self-regulation, self-motivation, as well as social relationships according to the psycho-EI theory.
              These four dimensions represent different aspects of EI, including perceiving emotions, managing emotions, and interpersonal relationships.
              The self-awareness reflects the ability to accurately identify own emotions and appraisal and expression of emotions encompassing the ability to be sensitive to the slight variations between emotions.
              The categories and intensities of sentiment words in the text can reflect the user’s sentiment. Through analyzing the emotional words of tweets published by users, we calculate the value of self-awareness.
